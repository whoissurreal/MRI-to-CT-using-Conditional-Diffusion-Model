# MRI-to-CT-using-Conditional-Diffusion-Model
Developed a hybrid diffusion framework combining DINOv2, CBAM, and residual U-Net for cross-modality MRI-to-CT synthesis. Used L1 + perceptual loss to balance pixel-level accuracy and visual quality, ensuring anatomically consistent and clinically reliable outputs.
